# Grayscale-Photo-Collage-Generator
A code for creating grayscale photo collages (AKA making a big picture out of a lot of little pictures)



Some notes on usage:

The code takes one large image, breaks it into smaller units, and maps one of five images to each unit.

These five images should be manipulated so that one is black, dark gray, gray, light gray, and white.

Save all the five images under one parent directory.

The code will only generate grayscale images, so for best conversion be sure to desaturize the large image to be constructed.

To preserve the quality of the five images comprising the collage, blow up the image to be converted to as large a size as possible,    that way a larger "box size" can be used (AKA more pixels per little image)
